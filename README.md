COVID-19 Global Data Tracker
*A Python-based data analysis project tracking global COVID-19 trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)*

Example Visualization

Project Description
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data from Our World in Data to:

Track cases, deaths, and vaccination trends over time

Compare country-level responses

Visualize key metrics using Python (pandas, matplotlib, Plotly)

Data Source: Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset

⚙️ Installation & Usage
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook (or VS Code with Jupyter extension)

Key Findings
1. Vaccination Rollout Disparities
US/UK achieved >50% vaccination by mid-2021, while Kenya reached ~10% by 2022.

Low-income countries faced 6-month delays in vaccine access.

2. Case Waves by Country
🇮🇳 India’s April 2021 surge (Delta variant) accounted for 50% of global cases at peak.

🇧🇷 Brazil maintained high death rates (>3,000/day) longer than other nations.

3. Death Rate Trends
Early pandemic death rates were highest in Europe (e.g., Italy: ~15% in March 2020).

By 2022, global death rates dropped to ~1% due to vaccines/treatments.

4. Data Limitations
Underreporting in Africa: Testing gaps may have hidden true case counts.

Inconsistent updates: Some countries reported weekly instead of daily.
